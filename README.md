# IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis (Course Project)

This repository contains my dataset analysis project for the course **Data Processing and Programming Technique**.

## Overview
- **Goal:** Explore and analyze the IMDB movie reviews dataset and build a basic sentiment analysis workflow.
- **Main notebook:** `Project.ipynb`
- **Dependencies:** `requirements.txt`

## What I did
- Load and inspect the dataset (columns, missing values, duplicates)
- Clean and preprocess text data (normalization steps inside the notebook)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Baseline sentiment analysis workflow in the notebook

## Dataset
To keep this repository lightweight, the dataset file is **not included**.
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle:  
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews
2. Place the file `IMDB Dataset.csv` in the project root (same folder as `Project.ipynb`).

## How to run
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
